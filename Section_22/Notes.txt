190. Backend Web Development Explained

Backend consists of 3 components
1. Server
2. Application = for logic to web app to function
3. Database = store and retrieve user data 


1. Server is just a computer
it should be ON 24/7 to listen to incoming requests
any computer that is connected to network can be a Server

local host 
own computer as the Server
when we are testing it


2. Application
logic running on the Server
like how we want to respond to the browser
it can send back data such as webpage/stuff/etc 
and status codes/ 404/500 etc


3. Database
store user data
if computer lost power, w/o Database, the information is lost
form of permanent storage of the web application 



webpages - only frontend that get requested from browser to the server 
only html, css and js


web application/web app = more than viewing web pages
eg : allowing users to log in : like email and password
now email and pwd will be sent to server in a request
as the server is on and is listening
and find the application to handle the login
eg : login.js file will handle

now look into the database and check the password 
and validate it against the entered password from the front end 
if they both match then send a response via a server in the form of homepage / home.html webpage 
if they do not match then send the login page and ask them to try again 

it is complex
because we have logic and multiple componenets are involved















191. Backend Web Technologies and Technologies

front end = HTML, CSS, Javascript
React, Angular & Vue all are javascript frameworks 

Backend = Java, RUBY,PhP, C#, python , Javascript 
frameworks include
java = springboot
ruby = rails
php = larvae
c# = asp.net 
python = django, flask
javascript = node.js 


Now lets start Node.js = Javascript Backend framework 
it is the most used framework for Backend
so it has most amount of documentation

Python Flask for machine learning web app
Php, ruby frameworks are declining
