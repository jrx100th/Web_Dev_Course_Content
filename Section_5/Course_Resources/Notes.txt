3 ways to adding CSS to HTML website

Inline
<tag style="css" />

Internal
<style>css</style>

External
<link href="style.css"/>


Inline

same line as html element
goes into the opening line of the html tag

<html style="background: blue">
</html>

style attribute - gloablly available, for image , break

style is the name of the attribute
"background: blue" is the value of the attribute

background is the property
blue is the value of the property

since it is applied to HTML tag the whole page will be blue


Internal

through style element
<html>
    <head>
        <style>
            html{
                background:red;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
</html>

now we have to add a selector- curly braces
the css goes in between those 2 curly braces(background:red;)



for multipage style we shoudl use external CSS

External CSS

this code is in a completly seperate file

so to apply it in our files we have to link it in our index file

style.css will have this
html{
    background:green;
}

index.html will have this in the corresponding component
like this
and will have 2 components
1. relationship, role of the thing that we are linking to
2. href, where is the file located

this link is a (self closing tag)
<html>
    <head>
        <link
            rel="stylesheet"
            href="./styles.css"
        />
    </head>
</html>






so in summary
inline is good when we are targetting single element
internal is good when we are targetting a single web page

external for multi page website = w=external way of adding stuff
it can target entire website with multiple web pages




## 34 CSS Selector elements




1. Element Selector


h1{
    color:blue
}

h1 is called css selector
selects html to apply the rules

it is a html selector
right now it is selecting all h1 tags

can apply to any tags => anchor,paragraph etc

element selector

eg:
index.html
<h2>red</h2>
<h2>green</h2>
<h2>blue</h2>


styles.css
h2{
    color:red;
}
now it targets all h2 tags





2. Class Selector

for different types of elements comes under the same class

.red-text{
    color: red
}

<h2 class="red-text">Red</h2>       # turns red
<h2>green</h2>                      # stays same
<h2>blue</h2>                       # stays same

selects the only element that has that class and changes it

now different element having the same class

<h2 class="red-text">Heading 2</h2>     # turns red
<h3>Heading</h3>
<p class="red-text">Paragraph</p>       # turns red



3. Id Selector

#main{
    color: red
}

selects all elements with particular id attribute

<h2 id="main">Red</h2>              # turns red
<h2>green</h2>                      # stays same
<h2>blue</h2>                       # stays same

difference between class selector and id selector
id - one element in single HTML file, unique
class - many elements, basically grouping




4. Attribute Selector

p[draggable]{        # here by default draggable is true
    color: red;
} 

select all paragraph elements that has attribute draggable, apply css style to it

<p draggable="true">Drag me</p>    #turns red
<p>Dont drag me</p>                # stays same
<p>Dont drag me</p>                # stays same



p[draggable="false"]{
    color: red;
}

<p draggable="true">Drag me</p>                      # stays same
<p draggable="false">Dont drag me</p>                # turns red
<p draggable="false">Dont drag me</p>                # turns Red




5. Universal Selector

*{
    color: red
}

it selects everything
where the stylesheet is active
