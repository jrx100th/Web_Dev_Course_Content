149. What is JQuery

Javascript framework
Saviour or coders hands from carpel matatunnel ("real")

for (i=0; i < document.querySelectorAll("button").length; i++){
    document.querySelectorAll("button")[i].addEventListener("click",function(){
        document.querySelectorAll("h1").style.color = "red";
    });
}

in the document querying for all button 
and querying again for h1 to turn them red 

this is pure Javascript again,

now Jquery
$("button").click(function(){
    $("h1).css("color","red");
})


Jquery allows us to take a line of code 
Javascript : document.querySelector("h1")
Jquery     : jquery("h1")
more simpler: $("h1")

3 lines of code does the same thing
















150. How to Incorporate Jquery into websites

@ jquery.com you can download the code files 
or use a CDN = content delivery network 

google CDN is most preferred
as it has been mostly used so 
when a user loads your website there is already a good chance that they might already load the jquery CDN from a popular one.


https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries

copied the script tag from here 
3. xsnippet

<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

$("h1").css("color","red");
selects the h1 and changes its css color property to red 

right now in console it gives an error and doesnt change the color of the h1

for it to be executed 
first jQuery script tag needs to be placed above javascript script tag 

if jQuery and javascript tags are placed in head, then
they are not ready
if the jquery library is not ready
we should check for it

using
$(document).ready(function(){
    $("h1").css("color","red");
}

now we are waiting till our jQuery library finished loading 
and then we access h1 to change its color 












151. How Minification works to reduce file size

https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.7.1/jquery.min.js
this is the minified version of the jquery library
when we visit
very unstructured data
same framework code but 
spaces,
new lines,
comments have been removed 
to reduce the file size

minifier.org = does the minification 

minifies javascript and css only
and also reduces the file space 

now size matters if the file is big then it will impact on the user side to load with their network

if downloaded from the web i mean 
if we download jQuery from the web.

there will be version
1. standard version with comments and clear explanation
2. minified version

we can actually make changes to jquery source code according to our requirements














152. Selecting Elements with Jquery

select elements in our webpage to manipulate later

document.querySelector("h1")
$("h1")

same 
as the css selector, as selecting elements in css 

eg : if we want h1 in the class of title
$("h1.title");

inside an id of header
$("#header h1");


when there are multiple buttons
we need to use 
document.querySelectorAll("button");
now it will return an array

$("button");
does the same thing
and using jquery
there is no difference between selecting 1 or selecting many
seems like it always returns list 














153. Manipulating Styles with Jquery 

$("h1").css("color","red");
selecting it and then tapping into the css property and change it 

and select the current color and console log it
console.log($("h1").css("color"));
rgb(0, 0, 0)

console.log($("h1").css("fontSSize"));
32px

when tapping into the properties use camelCasing

single value in css = getting the value
2 values in css = setting the value in it 


changing the style using js code is'nt good
we have concerns for seperation 

because 
js = behaviour
css = styling
html = content

and now we can add classes to other objects 
using jquery
Adding class : 
$("h1").addClass("big-title");
Removing class : 
$("h1").removeClass("big-title");

if i want to add or remove multiple classes
then just add them in the paranthesis just with a space

$("h1").addClass("big-title margin-50")

now margin-50 and big-title are two classes that are added to that object 


checking for them in the console
$("h1").hasClass("margin-50");
will return true















154. Manipulating Text with Jquery

manipulating the text inside an object using jquery

2 ways

1. 
$("h1").text("Bye");
$("button").text("Don't click me")

$("h1").text();
'Bye'
$("button").text();
"Don't click meDon't click meDon't click meDon't click meDon't click me

in plain old Javascript
we have innerHTML
to edit or view the innerHTML 

In Jquery it is simply
$("button").html("<em>Hey</em>)

most of the things in jquery we are using methods
accessing through methods

Jquery is completely written in javascript
and shortens things a lot 













155. Manipulating attributes with Jquery 

attributes are things such as src for img
href for links and anchor tags 

if we want to manipulate image attribute 
then

getting the attribute 

$("img").attr("src");
will give us string stored in src


setting the attribute 
$("a").attr("href","https://www.youtube.com")
will change the existing href to youtube
sets value 


class is also an html attribute 
$("h1").attr("class");
will print the all the applied classes that are applied to h1














156. Adding Event Listeners using jQuery

$("h1").click(function(){
    $("h1").css("color","purple")
})

Adding an event listener to all 5 buttons
regular = using a for loop

for (var i = 0 ; i < 5; i++){
    document.querySelectorAll("button")[i].addEventListener("click", function(){
        document.querySelector("h1").style.color = "purple";
    })
}

using jQuery
$("button").click(function(){
    $("h1").css("color","purple");
})


Keydown event listener
remember : keypress is depreciated

<input type="text">
will display a text box

detecting keystrones inside the text box

$("input").keydown(function(event){
    console.log(event.key);
})

will log keystroke into the console 

and simply we can change it to anything not just the input-text-box

$("body").keydown(function(event){
    console.log(event.key);
});

$(document).keydown(function(event){
    console.log(event.key);
});

now changing the code of this event listener 
so that h1 will become the letter/key stroke

instead of .keydown and .click there is a more flexible way of adding an event listener 

.on = takes 2 parameters

$("h1").on("mouseover", function(){
    $("h1").css("color","red");
});

when the mouse is on h1 area then color changes to red
i mean mouseover is just a single event that can be detected over the specified object 

$("h1").on("click", function(){
    $("h1").css("color","red");
});

But still doesnt clarify on how to target an object when there are multiple objects with the same specs 
like 2nd button or 3rd button,
like in regular js 
rather than selecting all the objects with the same specs















157. Adding and removing elements with jQuery 

eg :
now i want to add a button before the h1
using jquery


$("h1").before("<button>Before</button>")    add stuff before / in previous line
$("h1").after("<button>After</button>")      add stuff after / in the next line 

adding elemeents without messing with html 

and there are also prepend and append
which means they will appear just right before and after the element/target in the same line


$("h1").prepend("<button>Before</button>")
$("h1").append("<button>After</button>")

and when we inspect it has been added inside the h1
append and prepend are in like innerHTML 
just beside the text

but the before and after are before and after the h1 tag

now simply removing all the buttons

$("button").remove() will remove all the buttons in the document/current_web_page 














158. Website Animation with Jquery 

.hide()

will hide the selected element

// hide on clicking any button
$("button").click(function(){
    $("h1").hide()
})

// hide on clicking h1

$("h1").on("click",function(){
    $("h1").hide();
});

and to show it back
$("h1").show()

now clicking on h1 will hide the element and then 
clicking on any button will show it again

$("button").click(function(){
    $("h1").css("color","purple");
    $("h1").show();
})


$("h1").on("click",function(){
    $("h1").hide();
});


#### Now the legendary toggle on the button
$("h1").on("click",function(){
    $("h1").toggle();
});

now on every click on the button it will show and hide the h1

when hiding, the element gets removed from our html
and it is a sudden change
and the html elements will be pushed up

so for a slower hiding or fading 

we can use

.fadeOut()

$("button").on("click",function(){
    $("h1").fadeOut();
});

it will reduce the opacity of the element and then it will hide it
or remove it from the flow

this is funny like a basket ball
trying to use both and failed
$("button").on("click",function(){
    $("h1").toggle().fadeOut();
});

and fadeOut has its opposite fadeIn

.fadeIn() will appear slowly

instead of messing around with toggle and fadeOut together we 
have

.fadeToggle() option
$("button").on("click",function(){
    $("h1").fadeToggle();
});
will does the same thing
toggle the fading 

.slideUp() = collapse the selected element 
.slideDown() = uncollapse the selected element 

and similarly slideToggle()
$("button").on("click",function(){
    $("h1").slideToggle();
});


if we want more fine grained control over your animations
then instead of prebuilt ones like slideUp,slideDown,slideToggle,fade(*3)

we should use .animate() for making custom css

.animate({opacity: 0.5})

$("button").on("click",function(){
    $("h1").animate({opacity : 0.5});
});

on clicking the opacity will just be reduced
inside the animate function ()
we can only add numeric value in the curly braces,
so we cant just add stuff like changing color

and if it is percentages or something like that 
than use percentages

and i can just change stuff using combinations
not just using animate

$("button").on("click",function(){
    $("h1").slideUp().slideDown().animate({opacity : 0.5});
});

$("h1").slideUp().animate({opacity : 0.1}).slideDown().animate({opacity : 1});
another combo

the animations in the combo gets executed in an order

instead of memorizing just understand and try to use the documentation
