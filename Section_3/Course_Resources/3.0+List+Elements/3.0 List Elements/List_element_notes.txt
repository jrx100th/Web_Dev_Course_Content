lists
list of items

non void element

unordered list = <ul> <ul/>

lists are enclosed in un ordered lists

<ul>
    <li>bs</li> slash is in front
    <li>bs</li>
    <li>bs</li>
</ul>

just the same old bullet points


just the UL
will give bullet points


so there is another <ol></ol>
which is ordered list items

<ol>
    <li>bs</li> slash is in front
    <li>bs</li>
    <li>bs</li>
</ol>

now this will give the numbers from 1 to n
