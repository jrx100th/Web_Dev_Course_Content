anchor elements allows use to create hyperlinks


<a href = "google.com"> This is a link </a>

so just <a></a>  wont work
i need to have the href



HTML attributes

<tag attribute=value> Content </tag>

in case of multiple attributes, => seperate them by space

<tag attribute=value anotherattribute=value> Content </tag>


correct active link will e highlighted in blue 


## Global attributes
draggable = true

<a draggable=true href="reddit.com">here</a>

multiple attributes are seperated using space

href attribute is only for the anchor tag

global attribute is for all the tags
draggable is a global and works for all of them



we can even decide from where the numbers in the list are starting from

<ol start = 6>
