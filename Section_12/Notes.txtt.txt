69. Understanding Color theory

red - energy
yellow - attention grabbing

green - freshness, growth, safety

blue - stability trust serenity
purple- royalty, wealth, femenity

which colors to mix/combine

color wheel
analogous color

side by side colors on the wheel = for logo
not for standing out

complementery color pallete is for outstanding 
not for style text and text background with it 

equilateral triangle for triadic color pallete
quadrilateral/square

use Adobe color for the color combination
colorhunt.co 

Liebe yogurt has consistent color scheme









70. Typography and how to choose font 

Fonts matter in the sense of the context

serif family = have feet
inspired from marble carvings
so it can be used for magazine for architectural designs

and they are divided into more sub families

we can estimate how old is an font be the difference between the thickest and thinnest part of letter
so if the difference is big then it means the font is modern
and vice versa


different fonts have different moods

serif = traditional stable respectable

sans-serifs : novel approachable contemporary
Humanist sub family
for body text

2 fonts in a single section/design is suggested











71. Manage attention with UI 


humans get attracted to bigger, bolder, squarer things
can be used to build 

1. Hierarchy
    through size
            color 

2. Layout 
    length of the text div should not be too long or too short
    it should be in the medium size

3. Alignment
    Alignment relative to each other
    center align is lor better

    or both starting point for title and body should be the same
    that is a strong Alignment

    have less alignment lines 

4. White Space
    putting white space around the objects
    spacing things

5. Audience
    Adults and children
    Design should fit for the Audience












72. User Experience(UX) Design

1. Simplicity


2. consistent
make the components always consistent
across multiple web pages

3. Reading Pattern

F Pattern
start at the top left corner and then read the line and go down 


Z Pattern
when someone is browsing quickly
like social media
facebook uses it


4. All platform design

both mobile and desktop
handle the text size accordingly

try to use the available space in a aesthetic manner.
the website needs to rearrange itself when it is being rendered on different screen sizes


Get feedback

5. (Don't) Use your powers for evil

like highlighting the button of higher price
alog suggesting things that we dont need 

adding hairlines - 1 pixel curved line
and you click and the advertisers make money of each click
