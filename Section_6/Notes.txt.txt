1. Font size

1 px = 1 pixel = 1/96th of an inch = 0.26mm wide and tall (cube)

1 pt = 1 point = 1/72nd inch = 0.35mm

1 em = 100% of parent = full width of 'm' = same size as the parent tag
2 em = 2 times the size of the parent
it is relative size

1 rem = 100% of root
relative size
relative to the html 
root = html tag

difference between em and rem
em = parent size dependent
rem = html root size dependent

# The Box Model

Margin , Padding, Border, Width , Height = imp css properties

width : 600px is 600 pixels
width : 100% = 100% of website width



1. Border

border: 10px solid black
3 values seperated by space
thickness style color

the border goes outwards and not inwards

doesnt effect height and width

border : 30px solid black
    border-top: 0px

border-width: 0px 10px 20px 30px
it goes clock wisw
0px = top
10px = right
20px down
30px = left

if only two values are given to border width
then it will be 1&3 2&4
border-width : 0px 20px

top and bottom 0px
left and right 20px




2. Padding

if padding of 20px is added then it will push the border away from the content by 20px on all sides

height and width of the initial box for the content will not be changed but the border will be pushed away by 20px
maintaining the same color properties



3. Margin

outside the border, invisible ,maybe




padding, margin, 
border width
functions in same way 1&3 2&4
1,2,3,4






there is an image and i want to put a caption in it

so to put it in a box and contain it
wrap them together
through 

Content Division Element     HTML element
<div></div>

that can contain content in between opening and closing tags

and the content can be elements(html elements)

seperate boxes = divs



<body>
    <div>
        <p>Hello World</p>
        <img src="./world.png"/>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>good night wordl</p>
        <img src="./night-world.png">
    </div>
</body>

here div is  just containing the image and its caption
and they are invisible
due to its invisibility it can lead to errors, bugs

so installed pesticide chrome extension






By default paragraphs will have 1em of margin

so just
p{
    margin: 0
}

div{
    height:200px;
    width:200px;
}
